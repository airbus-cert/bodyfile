# bodyfile

bodyfile is a Golang library used to parse and process [bodyfile](https://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Body_file) that can be generated by various tools like [list_mft.py](http://www.williballenthin.com/forensics/mft/list_mft/), [regrippy](https://github.cert.corp/sgarrelou/regrippy) and so on (mostly Forensics tools).

Ok, the file's format is trivial. This library was built to support [timeliner](https://github.cert.corp/CERT/timeliner), an enhanced mactime-like.

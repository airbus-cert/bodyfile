# bodyfile

bodyfile is a Golang library used to parse and process [bodyfile](https://forensicswiki.xyz/wiki/index.php?title=Bodyfile) that can be generated by various tools like [list_mft.py](https://github.com/williballenthin/INDXParse/blob/master/list_mft.py), [regrippy](https://github.com/airbus-cert/regrippy) and so on (mostly Forensics tools).

This library was built to support [timeliner](https://github.com/airbus-cert/timeliner), an enhanced mactime-like.
